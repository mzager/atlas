# Cell Atlas of Worm

## Characterize new cell subtypes

![][1]

Our preliminary analysis shows that the worm contains cells, such as the ASE neurons, that are transcriptionally unique. That is, each animal contains a single cell that expresses a unique pattern of gene that no other cell shares. While we know the broad type of each cell, identifying the transcriptome signature of the many subtypes in the worm will be an ongoing project. You can dive into such analyses by reclustering the data or subsets of the data.
