# Mouse ATAC Atlas

In our manuscript ([Cusanovich and Hill, et al.][1]), we report single cell measurements of chromatin accessibility for 17 samples spanning 13 different tissues in 8-week old mice (_Mus. musculus_).

## Downloads

We have made our primary and secondary data available for the research community along with extensive documentation.

## Getting Started Tutorial

We've put together tutorials on how to get started with analysis of sci-ATAC-seq data.

[Tutorials »][3]

## Visualizations

![...][4]

We have a few interactive visualization tools in progress to explore some of our results. Currently we have an interactive version of our figure on cell-type specific heritability enrichments for UKBB traits available as an example.

## What is sci-ATAC-seq?

![...][6]

To generate these data we have used a technique we developed called sci-ATAC-seq ([_Cusanovich et al._, Science 2015][7]).

sci-ATAC-seq uses a paradigm called combinatorial indexing, where nucelic acids from cells are labeled with unique combinations of barcodes via multiple rounds of split-pool barcoding.
